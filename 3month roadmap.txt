Week 12: Revision and Mock Interviews
Theory:
Review your weak areas.
Go through all important concepts (arrays, recursion, DP).
Practice:
Solve mixed problems from previous topics to strengthen concepts.
Participate in mock interviews on platforms like InterviewBit or Pramp.
Key Focus:
Time management in solving problems.
Strengthen your communication in explaining solutions (important in interviews).
Additional Tips
Daily Problem Solving: Solve at least 3-5 problems daily on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.
Mock Interviews: Conduct regular mock interviews from Week 10 onwards.
Time Management: Focus on solving problems under time constraints, simulating real interview environments.
Consistency: Stick to the plan and make sure to dedicate time daily.
By following this structured approach, you’ll build strong problem-solving skills and improve your chances of cracking interviews at product-based companies.
